Syllabus for the program While you can find all the active games and trivia quests on the Google Cloud Arcade website directly, we are maintaining a copy of the same here so that it becomes easier for you to find badges and complete them so that you can earn "Arcade Points". (See points system for more details) Recommended - Its better to complete the games and trivia first since they have a deadline in a given month. Complete as many skill badges as you can later to earn more "Arcade Points". **Important Note:** - The Arcade and Trivia Games are going to start on August 5. Hence, its recommended that you complete as many skill badges as possible before that and wait for games to be released on 5th August. Arcade Games Every month we release 4 new Arcade games that you can complete to earn "Arcade Points". Hence, in a single cohort of 2 months under the Facilitator Program, you can earn a total of 8 game badges. See the currently active games for this month below. We will update these as and when new games will be released in the following months. Note: Games have limited seats, so enrol and complete them ASAP. Note: While there are a total of 4 games that are released every month and you can complete 8 games in total in the 2 months of the facilitator program, any 6 game completions will be counted towards the ultimate milestone. arcade-facilitator-basecamp-aug-badge Access code: 1q-basecamp-0871 arcade-facilitator-level1-aug-badge Access code: 1q-appdev-0868 arcade-facilitator-level2-aug-badge Access code: 1q-mlskills-0869 arcade-facilitator-level3-aug-badge Access code: 1q-functions-0870 Arcade Trivia Games Every month we release 4 new Trivia Games on a weekly basis, that you can complete to earn "Arcade Points".
